Steps to create a bootable Kali distribution on USB with Persistence using mac OS X

What you'll need
  - Mac running OS X (Catalina)
  - A portable flash drive (I used a SanDisk 32GB 2.0 USB Drive)
  - A Kali (live) iso (download here: https://www.kali.org/downloads/)
  - The SHA256Sum of your Kali iso (copy this when you download the iso)
  

Before proceeding forward, confirm the SHA256Sum of your downloaded file matches the one on https://www.kali.org/downloads/

*From Mac OS*

1. Boot up mac

NEXT STEP IS CRITICAL
2. Identify the location of your USB
   a. Open terminal and type  
           diskutil list
      to list the internal drives on your system - DO NOT EDIT THESE

   b. plug in the USB and retype
           diskutil list
      compare the output to that from step 2.a and identify the location of the new drive.  
      it will be something like
          /dev/diskX
      Note this location

3. Use the Disk Utility application (in /Application/Utilities) to erase the USB
   a. open Disk Utility and select the portable USB drive (left side of the app's window)
   b. Select erase
   c. From the menu, change format to MS-DOS (FAT)
      leave the remaining options as is

4. Unmount the USB. Go back to terminal and type
       diskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskX

5. Use dd to push the .iso to the USB.  In terminal type
       sudo dd if=location_and_name_of_iso of=/dev/rdiskX bs=4m
  This step will take some time to complete

Restart your machine and once you hear the chime press and hold the option key.
A screen will appear where you can select Macintosh HD, EFI Boot and possibly other options depending on your setup.
To boot Kali, select EFI boot.

The USB now contains the image and you can use it run live instances of Kali.

To add persistence, continue to the next set of instructions.

If you haven't already, restart your machine and boot a live instance of Kali (select Live)

*FROM KALI*

1. Open terminal and check your PATH variable (echo $PATH).  If PATH DOES include /sbin, then remove that from the terminal commands in the remaining instructions

2. identify the USB drive.  Open terminal and type in
    sudo /sbin/fdisk -l
    
   it will be something like /dev/sdX
   MAKE SURE THIS IS THE LOCATION OF THE USB DRIVE

3. Create a new partition for persistence.  In terminal, type
    sudo /sbin/cfdisk /dev/sdX
    
    a partition table will open
    
4. Create the new partition
   a. From the partition table, select
         Free space
      in the Device column
   b. Press enter to use all available space (or edit the amount of space you want to use)
   c. You'll see an option at the bottom of the partition table of [primary] and [extended]
      select [primary] and press enter
   d. Looking at the options at the bottom of the partition table, select [ Write ], and press enter
   e. You'll be asked "Are you sure you want to write the partition table to disk?"
      type
          yes
      and press enter
   f. Looking at the options at the bottom of the partition table, select [ Quit ], and press enter.  You will be brought back to the terminal
   
5. Examine the disk again to see the new partition.  In terminal, type
    sudo /sbin/fdisk -l
    
   Note the location of the new partition, it will be something like
       /dev/sdX

6. Create persistence.  From terminal, type
    sudo mkfs.ext4 -L persistence /dev/sdX
    
   Close all terminal windows

7. Create the persistence configuration file.  
   a. From desktop, open file manager and select persistence
   b. Open a terminal from here (path is /media/kali/persistence/) and create a persistence.conf file. 
          sudo touch persistence.conf
          
   c. open file (you can use a command like sudo nano persistence.conf ) and add the following text
          / union
      save and close the file
      
   d. From the terminal, use cat to show the file contents.  Type
          cat persistence.conf

8. close all windows and restart the machine

9. Restart your machine and once you hear the chime press and hold the option key.
   A screen will appear where you can select Macintosh HD, EFI Boot and possibly other options depending on your setup.
   Select EFI boot.

10. Select Live USB with Persistence


You now have a Kali bootable USB with persistence.  
To test the persistence, make some changes (like the desktop background picture) and create a text file with some content.
Once you're done, reboot the machine following steps 9 and 10 above.  Your selected desktop picture and any files you created will be intact.

Enjoy!
